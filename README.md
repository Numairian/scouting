For the First Robotics season of 2015, our team will continue to use an ever-changing and adapting copy of the program affectionately named Robot eHarmony. With this tool, we aim to easily and accurately collect robot data mid-match, compile and analyze all existing data, and produce a final output to gauge the effectivenss of this competitor in congunction with our own device. 

This script to be used with the internet chat client mIRC, utilizing the GUI like functions and simple data storage and transfer. The contents of this program should be added to the REMOTE section of mIRC's script editor, unless specifically instructed otherwise. Check to be sure you're not entering the script into the ALIAS section of your script editor.

There is no method of traditional initilization with mIRC script after it has been entered into your script editor. A list of commands for operating and manipulating the program components will be provided as soon as possible- A copy of this list will be found in this README file. Along with this list of commands will be specific intructions related to downloading, installing, and maintaining a preferred mIRC setup. 

Any questions or concerns should be directed to the creator of this file, Sarah Bultman (also known as "The Danny Puncher")
